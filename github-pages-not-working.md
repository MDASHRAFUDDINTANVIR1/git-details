# ðŸš€ Fixing GitHub Pages Not Working Due to Missing `index.html`

When using **GitHub Pages**, it looks for an `index.html` file as the homepage. If your repository doesn't have `index.html`, your website may not load properly. Below are solutions to fix this issue.

## âœ… Solution 1: Rename `demo.html` to `index.html`

If your repository has a file like `demo.html`, but **GitHub Pages is not working**, rename it to `index.html` using Git.

### ðŸ“Œ Steps:

1. **Rename the File Using Git Command:**
   ```bash
   git mv demo.html index.html
   ```

2. **Commit the Changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Renamed demo.html to index.html"
   ```

3. **Push the Changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Check Your GitHub Pages Link:**  
   Now, visit your GitHub Pages link:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```
   Your website should load properly with `index.html` as the main page.

## âœ… Solution 2: Use a Folder in GitHub Pages (e.g., `docs` Folder)

You can store your HTML file inside a folder (like `docs`) and set GitHub Pages to use that folder.

### ðŸ“Œ Steps:

1. **Create a Folder and Move Your HTML File:**
   ```bash
   mkdir docs
   mv index.html docs/
   ```

2. **Commit and Push the Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Moved index.html to docs folder"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Change GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Go to **Settings** in your repository.
   - Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**.
   - Under **Source**, select **`docs/` folder**.

4. **Check Your GitHub Pages Link:**
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```

Now, your website will load the `index.html` file from the `docs` folder.

## âœ… Solution 3: Use a Custom File Name in GitHub Pages URL

If you **don't want to rename your file** but still want to access it, you need to **manually specify the file name** in the URL.

### ðŸ“Œ Steps:

1. **Ensure Your File Exists in the Repository**  
   Example: If your file is `demo.html`, it should be visible in your repository.

2. **Access the File Using This URL:**
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/demo.html
   ```

Now, your file will open directly without renaming it.

## âœ… Solution 4: Using a `gh-pages` Branch (For Deployed Projects)

For **React, Angular, Vue, or other built projects**, itâ€™s best to use a `gh-pages` branch.

### ðŸ“Œ Steps:

1. **Create a `gh-pages` Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b gh-pages
   ```

2. **Commit Your `index.html` in `gh-pages` Branch:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up gh-pages branch with index.html"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages for `gh-pages` Branch:**
   - Go to **Settings > GitHub Pages**.
   - Select **`gh-pages`** as the source.

4. **Check Your GitHub Pages Link:**
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```

Now, your site will load properly.

## ðŸ”¥ Conclusion

| Solution | When to Use |
|----------|------------|
| **Rename `demo.html` to `index.html`** | If GitHub Pages is not loading your file. |
| **Use `docs/` Folder** | If you want a cleaner repo structure. |
| **Use a Custom File URL** | If you don't want to rename `demo.html`. |
| **Use `gh-pages` Branch** | If working with frameworks like React. |

### ðŸ“¢ If GitHub Pages Still Doesn't Work:
- **Wait a few minutes** â€“ sometimes it takes time to update.
